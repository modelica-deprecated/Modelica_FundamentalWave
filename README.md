# Modelica_FundamentalWave

Free library for the modeling of spatial fundamental wave effects of electro magnetic quantities in electric machines. (Still using Modelica Standard Library 2.2.2!) This library is included in the Modelica Standard Library since version 3.1.

## Library description

This library contains components for modelling of electromagnetic fundamental wave models for the application in electric machines. This library is an alternative approach to the Modelica.Electrical.Machines library. A great advantage of this library is the strict object orientation of the electrical and magnetic components that the electric machines models are composed of. From a didactic point of view this library is very beneficial for students in the field of electrical engineering.
